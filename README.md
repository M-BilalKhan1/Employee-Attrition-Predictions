The code leverages XGBoost, a powerful gradient boosting algorithm, to train a model for predicting employee attrition. It first addresses class imbalance by resampling the minority class in the training dataset to ensure better model performance. Hyperparameters are tuned using GridSearchCV to find the optimal settings for the model. The model's performance is then evaluated on the test set using multiple metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. A confusion matrix is displayed to show the distribution of predictions, while feature importance is visualized to highlight the most influential variables affecting employee attrition.
