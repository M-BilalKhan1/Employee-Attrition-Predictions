The code uses XGBoost, a highly efficient machine learning algorithm based on gradient boosting, to model employee attrition prediction. The algorithm builds an ensemble of decision trees sequentially, optimizing the model by minimizing errors with each new tree. This approach is known for its performance and accuracy, especially with structured/tabular data. The dataset used contains employee information, and to improve model performance, class imbalance is addressed by resampling the minority class. Hyperparameters are fine-tuned using GridSearchCV to find the optimal settings for the XGBoost classifier. Model evaluation is done using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix, providing insights into how well the model predicts employee attrition and which features contribute the most to predictions.
